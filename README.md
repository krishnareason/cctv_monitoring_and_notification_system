üìπ Smart CCTV Camera Monitoring System


A powerful real-time CCTV monitoring dashboard designed for critical infrastructure like power plants, where dozens of cameras must be constantly supervised. This project provides a centralized dashboard, real-time status updates, and automated email/SMS alerts when any camera goes offline.


üìà Problem Statement

In environments such as power plants, cameras are deployed to monitor sensitive zones. However, when one goes offline, it's hard for the monitoring team to immediately detect it. Delayed response to such outages can be dangerous.
